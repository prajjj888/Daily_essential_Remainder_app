
In today's fast-paced and demanding world, individuals often struggle to keep track of their daily
tasks, appointments, and essential activities. The lack of an efficient and organized system leads to
missed deadlines, forgotten commitments, and increased stress levels. It can be very frustrating for
an individual to loose the time sense in their daily tasks as well and forgetting important activities or
essentials. Existing manual methods of task management, such as pen-and-paper lists or basic
calendar apps, often prove inadequate in effectively addressing these challenges. Consequently, there
is a pressing need for a comprehensive solution that simplifies task management, enhances
productivity, and promotes better time management skills.


Daily Essential Reminder app is an application developed using android studio. The app's task
scheduling feature allows users to set remainder on the things they want to be reminded off, enabling
better time management and reducing the risk of missing important deadlines.
The reminder functionality plays a crucial role in ensuring that users never forget essential tasks or
appointments. Customizable notifications can be set up to alert users at specific times or intervals
making it easy to stay on top of daily responsibilities.
Users can login with the email id and password and if they have not been registered user can register
with a new email id and password of their choice. The app's intuitive design and user-friendly
interface further contribute to a positive user experience, encouraging regular usage and adherence to
task management practices.
